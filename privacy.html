                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Halfway helps you find places between you and your friends so you can meet in the middle and
                        easily turn those spots into events you can manage and join. We value your privacy and are
                        committed to being transparent about how we collect, use, and share your information.</p>

                    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>

                    <h3>Account Data</h3>
                    <p>Email (if provided by your sign-in provider), user ID, and authentication metadata.</p>

                    <h3>Profile & Social</h3>
                    <p>Display name, username, bio, profile image, follower/following counts, follow requests, and
                        privacy settings (e.g., discoverability and location sharing).</p>

                    <h3>Location Data</h3>
                    <p>Your device location when you use location features, your saved "anchor location," meet points
                        you choose to share, and map interactions needed for midpoints and routes.</p>

                    <h3>Content You Provide</h3>
                    <p>Favorites, meetups and participation status, comments, messages you send in-app, and lists you
                        create and share.</p>

                    <h3>Device & App</h3>
                    <p>Device model, OS version, language, time zone, and app version.</p>

                    <h3>Diagnostics</h3>
                    <p>Crash logs and error reports (Crashlytics). We do not use third‑party advertising SDKs or
                        cross‑app ad tracking.</p>

                    <h3>Notifications</h3>
                    <p>A device push token to deliver notifications you opt into (meetup invites/updates, follows).</p>

                    <h2>How We Use Data</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Core Features:</strong> Authenticate you; enable profiles, follows, invites, RSVPs;
                            calculate midpoints and routes; show nearby places.</li>
                        <li><strong>Location & Anchors:</strong> Calculate and display meeting points and routes; show
                            your saved anchor location to others according to your settings.</li>
                        <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> Remember preferences (e.g., units, map type) and surface
                            relevant suggestions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> Send push or in‑app notifications for invites, RSVPs,
                            cancellations, and follows according to your preferences.</li>
                        <li><strong>Safety & Integrity:</strong> Prevent spam/abuse and enforce our Terms.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Diagnose crashes and improve performance and accessibility.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>

                    <h3>With Other Users</h3>
                    <p>What you choose to share (profile, follows, meetups, anchors) is visible based on your privacy
                        controls. If you enable discovery by non‑friends, people who don't follow you may only see an
                        approximate, city‑level location; your exact anchor is visible only to mutual followers when
                        enabled. You can also hide your anchor from specific users.</p>

                    <h3>Service Providers</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Maps:</strong> Apple MapKit and OpenStreetMap Overpass API process
                            map/route/location data under their respective policies.</li>
                        <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Cloud Functions, Cloud Messaging,
                            Storage) processes and stores app data on our behalf.</li>
                        <li><strong>Diagnostics:</strong> Firebase Crashlytics for crash reports.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Legal</h3>
                    <p>We may disclose information to comply with law or protect safety, rights, or property.</p>

                    <h3>No Sale/Ads</h3>
                    <p>We do not sell personal data. We do not use third‑party advertising networks or cross‑app ad
                        tracking.</p>

                    <h2>Location and Storage</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Session Use:</strong> Real‑time location is processed when features require it
                            (e.g., map, midpoint).</li>
                        <li><strong>Saved Data:</strong> Anchors, favorites, profiles, follows, meetups, and
                            notifications are stored in Firebase so you can access them across devices.</li>
                        <li><strong>Media:</strong> Profile images are stored in Firebase Storage.</li>
                        <li><strong>Local Data:</strong> Certain preferences and caches are stored on your device.</li>
                        <li><strong>Retention:</strong> We keep data for as long as your account is active or as needed
                            to provide the service. You can delete anchors, favorites, and your account at any time; we
                            then delete associated data subject to legal and operational requirements.</li>
                        <li><strong>International Transfers:</strong> Firebase and Apple services may process data in
                            other countries with appropriate safeguards.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li><strong>Social & Discovery:</strong> Choose whether non‑friends can find you; manage

                            currently available). You can delete your account in‑app; this removes your Auth account and
                            stored data, subject to legal and operational requirements.</li>
