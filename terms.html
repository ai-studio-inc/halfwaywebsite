                    <h2>1. Use of the Service</h2>
                    <p>Halfway is a social iOS app for finding fair meeting places between multiple locations and
                        turning them into real meetups with friends. It combines midpoint place discovery with a
                        lightweight social graph, events, and push notifications. You may use the Service only for
                        lawful, personal, and non-commercial purposes. You agree not to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Copy, distribute, or modify any part of the Service without permission.</li>
                        <li>Attempt to reverse-engineer or disrupt the functionality of the Service.</li>
                        <li>Use the Service for any unlawful or harmful activity.</li>
                    </ul>
